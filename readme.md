# American Sign Language Detection
This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) detection system. It detects hand gestures and converts them into corresponding ASL alphabets.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.10.* installed on your system. After installing Python, follow the below steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file and extract it.

2. Open the command prompt/terminal in the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install all the necessary libraries:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
## Usage
To run the ASL detection, you can either run the live-detection.py file directly or use the following command in the command prompt/terminal:

```python live-detection.py```
This will start the real-time ASL detection system. You can then use your webcam to make hand gestures and the system will detect and display the corresponding ASL alphabets.
